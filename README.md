# Professional Software and Career Practices Final Project

# A Global Analysis of Renewable Energy's Impact on CO2 Emissions

This project analyzes the relationship between renewable energy production and CO2 emissions; 
with a focus on the top contributors to renewable energy production, by Gross National Income grouping
& studying the different types of renewable energy.

## Data Sources
I used 2 datasets, from Our World in Data
- Modern Renewable Energy Generation: (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/modern-renewable-prod?tab=table)
- Annual CO2 Emissions: (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co2-emissions-per-country?tab=table)
  
## Repository Files

annual-co2-emissions-per-country.csv
modern-renewable-prod.csv
- The 2 datasets I used for the project

EnergyProject.py
- My main coding space where I programmed my visualisations and committed my updates
  
requirements.txt
- The necessary Python libraries required to run the project.

## Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/joesmy/CircleCI.git
   
2. Head to the project directory:
   cd CircleCI

3. Install the required Python libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the main script to reproduce the analysis:
   python EnergyProject.py

## Repository Features
Data Transformation- 2 datasets are merged into one and cleaned

Visualisation- Creates multiple line graphs and pie charts from the datasets

## Continuous Integration
The repository is connected with CircleCI to maintain code reliability
